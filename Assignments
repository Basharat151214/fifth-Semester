A fault management system is required to detect faults in computers in the labs at FAST-NUCES Peshawar. These faults are reported by
users who can also track the progress on the faults they have added. The computer labs are assigned to technicians. A technician 
gets notification for a fault assigned to a computer in his lab. A technician can fix a fault, add comments to it that would be shared 
with the user who has added the fault. On fixing a fault, the fault moves from faults pending list to the completed tasks list.
A user shall be able to select a computer and view logged faults for the selected computer. A user who is logged in shall be able
to log new faults for a computer. A technician shall be able to edit faults. Any person is allowed to register as a user but must 
have a unique name. Only technical users (Technicians) are allowed to create new technical users. A search option shall be provided 
to allow the generation of fault lists based on key words entered by the user. For example the status of a fault, or the person reporting,
or the date a fault was reported. It shall be possible to assign a Technician a number of labs for which they are responsible.
If a fault is logged then it will automatically be assigned to the technician who has responsibility for the lab. 
Each fault has a unique number, status (open, close, allocated or under review), description, user (who added the fault),
technician (to whom fault is assigned). The system does some statistical analysis and will present the top 3 users as those who has 
identified most faults in a month as top users and top 3 technicians who have fixed most faults in a month.
